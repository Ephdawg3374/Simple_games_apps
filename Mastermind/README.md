# Mastermind

[Mastermind][wiki-mastermind]

* There are six different peg colors:
    * Red
    * Green
    * Blue
    * Yellow
    * Orange
    * Purple
* The computer will select a random code of four pegs. (Duplicate colors
  are allowed.)
* The user gets ten turns to guess the code.
    * You decide how the user inputs his guess (maybe like so: "RGBY"
      for red-green-blue-yellow)
* The computer should tell the player how many exact matches (right
  color in right spot) and near matches (right color, wrong spot) he
  or she has.
* The game ends when the user guesses the code, or is out of turns.

To play, go to terminal, navigate to root directory, and then load the 'mastermind_script.rb' file.
